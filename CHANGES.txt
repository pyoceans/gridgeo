Changelog
---------

Version 1.0.0

* Construct the grid based on the variables rather the datasets.
  The variables are CF's smallest unit and the only way to get a unique valid grid for SGRID.
* Dropped the dependency on iris, cartopy, pysgrid, and pyugrid.
* Dropped raster object in lieu of the actual x,y or triangle data for plotting.
* Added an option to reduce the precision for the GeoJSON.
* Grid parsing is now done with a grid-aware CFVariable object.
* Dropped parsing grid from iris.cube.
* Grids names are 'ugrid', 'sgrid', 'unknown_1d', and 'unknown_2d'.

Version 0.2.1

* Use latest pysgrid API.

Version 0.2.0

* Parse iris cubes with more than one X, Y axis.

Version 0.1.0

* Added a properties for raster representation (via the rasterize method)
  and vector outline (via shapely's' cascaded_union).
* Re-factor the package into utilities.py and gridgeo.py.
* Removed precision argument. (Created degenerated polygons.)
* The __repr__ now return the original grid __repr__ if u/s-grid
  or the original nc object if the grid is "unknown."
* Simplified the GridGeo class.
  (Moved all the loading stuff to load_grid.)
* Caching expensive computations.

Version 0.0.1

* First version of `gridgeo`.
